babasite
========

babasite is (for now) an educational project to explore the creation of multi-player games.

We started with a simple index.html and a 2D canvas. We created the heaven and the earth and the sun
(painted two rectangles, one blue and one green and a yellow circle).
We tried to picture ourselves in that world (draw a stick figure). And it was fun.

Then we animated this lifeless world and adjusted the movement of the sun. And added endless clouds
to shake things up. Ah, the possibilities! But we are all alone in our new worldsâ€¦ so we need to
connect our worlds together, with a websocket server.

Stay tuned!
